# Google OAuth Fix for ReviewFlow

This repository contains the fixed implementation of Google OAuth for the ReviewFlow application. It properly opens a popup window for the Google authorization flow instead of showing the URL as a message.

## Files Included

1. **`oauth-callback.html`** - The HTML page that handles the OAuth callback from Google
2. **`GoogleBusinessProfileIntegration.tsx`** - The React component with the fixed OAuth implementation
3. **`google_oauth_fix.js`** - A standalone JavaScript version of the fix that can be applied directly in the browser console
4. **`google_oauth_implementation_guide.md`** - A detailed guide for implementing the OAuth fix

## How It Works

When a user clicks "Connect Google My Business", this implementation:

1. Opens a popup window with the Google authorization page
2. Handles the OAuth callback properly using the `oauth-callback.html` page
3. Processes the authorization code and connects the account
4. Closes the popup window and updates the UI to show the connected state

## Implementation Steps

1. Add the `oauth-callback.html` file to your site's root directory
2. Update the `GoogleBusinessProfileIntegration.tsx` component with the fixed implementation
3. Build and deploy your application

## Testing

You can test the fix by:

1. Opening your browser console on the Settings page
2. Pasting the code from `google_oauth_fix.js`
3. Clicking "Connect Google My Business"

## Requirements

- Google OAuth client ID and secret must be properly configured in your Supabase environment variables
- The OAuth redirect URI must be set to your site's domain + `/oauth-callback.html`
